Springies Part 2

Bill Muensterman
Jerry Li

We started January 8
We finished February 14th
(This consists of all parts)


We used sodamathspaperfull.pdf as a reference

Bill dealt with gravity and viscosity, fixed mass, and wall repulsion.

Jerry dealt with center of mass, muscles, factory input, and the force abstract class

Both of us contributed to code formatting.

Files used to starthe project: Main.java

We use sounds and images from the sounds and images and data packages in source
 
The program uses .xps files that the user chooses after running the program. We provide two example data files.
Program runs off data file example.xps and example2.xps in data package
 
Center of mass makes balls go crazy if balls get really close to center of mass. This is somewhat expected given the 
equation for the force vector.

Also, Bill had trouble with git, so most if not all of our commits came from Jerry's Computer.

We want to emphasize that each person worked equally hard and productively on this assignment. 



Pressing c will clear all objects.

Pressing n allows a loading of a new assembly.

Pressing g turns off gravity

Pressing v turns off viscosity

Pressing up/down arrow changes canvas size

Pressing 1, 2, 3, 4, turns off wall repulsion for each respective wall. 

Clicking and holding mouse will generate a spring from mouse to closest mass.
Spring will disappear once mouse is released



This assignment really highlighted the importance of good design. I really liked how the project was split into parts
and the workload was reasonable. Total, for all parts, we worked about 20 hours. Part 3 took about 5-6 hours.


We liked this project.
